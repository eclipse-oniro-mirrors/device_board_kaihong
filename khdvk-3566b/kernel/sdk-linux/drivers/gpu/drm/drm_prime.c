/**
 * DOC: overview and lifetime rules
 *
 * Similar to GEM global names, PRIME file descriptors are also used to share
 * buffer objects across processes. They offer additional security: as file
 * descriptors must be explicitly sent over UNIX domain sockets to be shared
 * between applications, they can't be guessed like the globally unique GEM
 * names.
 *
 * Drivers that support the PRIME API implement the
 * &drm_driver.prime_handle_to_fd and &drm_driver.prime_fd_to_handle operations.
 * GEM based drivers must use drm_gem_prime_handle_to_fd() and
 * drm_gem_prime_fd_to_handle() to implement these. For GEM based drivers the
 * actual driver interfaces is provided through the &drm_gem_object_funcs.export
 * and &drm_driver.gem_prime_import hooks.
 *
 * &dma_buf_ops implementations for GEM drivers are all individually exported
 * for drivers which need to overwrite or reimplement some of them.
 *
 * Reference Counting for GEM Drivers
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * On the export the &dma_buf holds a reference to the exported buffer object,
 * usually a &drm_gem_object. It takes this reference in the PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD
 * IOCTL, when it first calls &drm_gem_object_funcs.export
 * and stores the exporting GEM object in the &dma_buf.priv field. This
 * reference needs to be released when the final reference to the &dma_buf
 * itself is dropped and its &dma_buf_ops.release function is called.  For
 * GEM-based drivers, the &dma_buf should be exported using
 * drm_gem_dmabuf_export() and then released by drm_gem_dmabuf_release().
 *
 * Thus the chain of references always flows in one direction, avoiding loops:
 * importing GEM object -> dma-buf -> exported GEM bo. A further complication
 * are the lookup caches for import and export. These are required to guarantee
 * that any given object will always have only one uniqe userspace handle. This
 * is required to allow userspace to detect duplicated imports, since some GEM
 * drivers do fail command submissions if a given buffer object is listed more
 * than once. These import and export caches in &drm_prime_file_private only
 * retain a weak reference, which is cleaned up when the corresponding object is
 * released.
 *
 * Self-importing: If userspace is using PRIME as a replacement for flink then
 * it will get a fd->handle request for a GEM object that it created.  Drivers
 * should detect this situation and return back the underlying object from the
 * dma-buf private. For GEM based drivers this is handled in
 * drm_gem_prime_import() already.
