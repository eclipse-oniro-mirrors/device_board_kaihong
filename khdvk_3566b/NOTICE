USB Driver for GSM modems

Copyright (C) 2005  Matthias Urlichs <smurf@smurf.noris.de>

Portions copied from the Keyspan driver by Hugh Blemings <hugh@blemings.org>

History: see the git log.

Work sponsored by: Sigos GmbH, Germany <info@sigos.de>

This driver exists because the "normal" serial driver doesn't work too well
with GSM modems. Issues:
- data loss -- one single Receive URB is not nearly enough
- nonstandard flow (Option devices) control
- controlling the baud rate doesn't make sense

This driver is named "option" because the most common device it's
used for is a PC-Card (with an internal OHCI-USB interface, behind
which the GSM interface sits), made by Option Inc.

Some of the "one port" devices actually exhibit multiple USB instances
on the USB bus. This is not a bug, these ports are used for different
device features.
